# MLOps- Learning Repo.

## Welcome to the MLOps Learning Repository! ðŸš€

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Thank you for visiting this repository.

## About Me

I'm a passionate learner exploring the fascinating world of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps). I created this repository as a part of my learning journey.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this repository are:

1. **Learn and Understand MLOps**: To gain a deep understanding of MLOps principles, practices, and tools.
2. **Hands-On Practice**: To get hands-on experience with implementing MLOps in various machine learning projects.
3. **Share Knowledge**: To share what I've learned with the community and help others who are also on this learning journey.

## What is MLOps?.

### First things first, what really is MLOps?.

**MLOps**, or **DevOps for Machine Learning**, is the practice of combining **Machine Learning**, **DevOps**, and **Data Engineering** to standardize and streamline the machine learning lifecycle. This lifecycle includes steps like data preparation, model training, model deployment, monitoring, and more.

### Why MLOps?

MLOps aims to bridge the gap between **Data Science** and **Operations**. It enables faster experimentation and deployment of models, reproducibility of experiments, and seamless collaboration.
